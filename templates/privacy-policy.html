While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="PIIProtection">2. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Wactop discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Wactop's behalf or to provide services available at Wactop's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country; by using Wactop's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Wactop will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above, Wactop discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Wactop believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Wactop, third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of http://www.wactop.com/ and have supplied your email address, Wactop may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Wactop and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Wactop takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Affiliates">4. Affiliate Disclosure</h2><p>This site uses affiliate links and does earn a commission from certain links. This does not affect your purchases or the price you may pay.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Ecommerce">5. E-commerce</h2><p>Those who engage in transactions with Wactop â€“ by purchasing Wactop's services or products, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="businesstransfers">6.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Wactop may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
